Description
-----------
This is version 0.01 of CGI::Widget::Path

This package is a simple HTML navigation path bar builder.
CGI::Widget::Path lets you build a navigation path bar (you know: "You are
here: Home > some > page") in order to put it your HTML pages.
This module is very simple but it can be useful if you create a path component
at the top of your application and share it among all sub-pages.

See perldoc CGI::Widget::Path for module documentation and use
